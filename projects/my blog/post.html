          is a musical composition intended to be vocally performed by the human
          voice. This is often done at distinct and fixed pitches (melodies)
          using patterns of sound and silence. Songs contain various forms, such
          as those including the repetition and variation of sections. Written
          words created specifically for music or for which music is
          specifically created, are called lyrics. If a pre-existing poem is set
          to composed music in classical music it is an art song. Songs that are
          sung on repeated pitches without distinct contours and patterns that
          rise and fall are called chants. Songs composed in a simple style that
          are learned informally "by ear" are often referred to as folk songs.
          Songs that are composed for professional singers who sell their
          recordings or live shows to the mass market are called popular songs.
          These songs, which have broad appeal, are often composed by
          professional songwriters, composers, and lyricists. Art songs are
          composed by trained classical composers for concert or recital
          performances. Songs are performed live and recorded on audio or video
          (or, in some cases, a song may be performed live and simultaneously
          recorded). Songs may also appear in plays, musical theatre, stage
          shows of any form, and within operas, films, and TV shows.

        <h3>Sunset</h3>

        <p>
          <b
            ><i><u>Sunset</u></i></b
          >, also known as sundown, is the daily disappearance of the Sun below
          the horizon due to Earth's rotation. As viewed from the Equator, the
          equinox Sun sets exactly due west in both Spring and Autumn. As viewed
          from the middle latitudes, the local summer Sun sets to the northwest
          for the Northern Hemisphere, but to the southwest for the Southern
          Hemisphere. The time of sunset is defined in astronomy as the moment
          when the upper limb of the Sun disappears below the horizon. Near the
          horizon, atmospheric refraction causes sunlight rays to be distorted
          to such an extent that geometrically the solar disk is already about
          one diameter below the horizon when a sunset is observed. Sunset is
          distinct from twilight, which is divided into three stages, the first
          being civil twilight, which begins once the Sun has disappeared below
          the horizon, and continues until it descends to 6 degrees below the
          horizon; the second phase is nautical twilight, between 6 and 12
          degrees below the horizon; and the third is astronomical twilight,
          which is the period when the Sun is between 12 and 18 degrees below
          the horizon.[1] Dusk is at the very end of astronomical twilight, and
          is the darkest moment of twilight just before night.[2] Night occurs
          when the Sun reaches 18 degrees below the horizon and no longer
          illuminates the sky. Locations further North than the Arctic Circle
          and further South than the Antarctic Circle experience no full sunset
          or sunrise on at least one day of the year, when the polar day or the
          polar night persists continuously for 24 hours.
