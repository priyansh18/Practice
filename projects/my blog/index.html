            Song is a musical composition intended to be vocally performed by
            the human voice. This is often done at distinct and fixed pitches
            (melodies) using patterns of sound and silence. Songs contain
            various forms, such as those including the repetition and variation
            of sections. Written words created specifically for music or for
            which music is specifically created, are called lyrics. If a
            pre-existing poem is set to composed music in classical music it is
            an art song. Songs that are sung on repeated pitches without
            distinct contours and patterns that rise and fall are called chants.
            Songs composed in a simple style that are learned informally "by
            ear" are often referred to as folk songs. Songs that are composed
            for professional singers who sell their recordings or live shows to
            the mass market are called popular songs. These songs, which have
            broad appeal, are often composed by professional songwriters,
            composers, and lyricists. Art songs are composed by trained
            classical composers for concert or recital performances. Songs are
            performed live and recorded on audio or video (or, in some cases, a
            song may be performed live and simultaneously recorded). Songs may
            also appear in plays, musical theatre, stage shows of any form, and
            within operas, films, and TV shows. A song may be for a solo singer,
            a lead singer supported by background singers, a duet, trio, or
            larger ensemble involving more voices singing in harmony, although
            the term is generally not used for large classical music vocal forms
            including opera and oratorio, which use terms such as aria and
            recitative instead.[1] A song can be sung without accompaniment by
            instrumentalists (a cappella) or accompanied by instruments. In
            popular music, a singer may perform with an acoustic guitarist,
            pianist, organist, accordionist, or a backing band. In jazz, a
            singer may perform with a single pianist, a small combo (such as a
            trio or quartet), or with a big band. A Classical singer may perform
            with a single pianist, a small ensemble, or an orchestra. In jazz
            and blues, singers often learn songs "by ear" and they may improvise
            some melody lines. In Classical music, melodies are written by
            composers in sheet music format, so singers learn to read music.

            Sunset, also known as sundown, is the daily disappearance of the Sun
            below the horizon due to Earth's rotation. As viewed from the
            Equator, the equinox Sun sets exactly due west in both Spring and
            Autumn. As viewed from the middle latitudes, the local summer Sun
            sets to the northwest for the Northern Hemisphere, but to the
            southwest for the Southern Hemisphere. The time of sunset is defined
            in astronomy as the moment when the upper limb of the Sun disappears
            below the horizon. Near the horizon, atmospheric refraction causes
            sunlight rays to be distorted to such an extent that geometrically
            the solar disk is already about one diameter below the horizon when
            a sunset is observed.

            A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). The biological function of a flower is to affect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) resulting from cross pollination or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower) when self pollination occurs. Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds.

In addition to facilitating the reproduction of flowering plants, flowers have long been admired and used by humans to bring beauty to their environment, and also as objects of romance, ritual, religion, medicine and as a source of food.
